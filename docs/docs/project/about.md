# About ArqonHPO

ArqonHPO is developed by **NovelByte Labs**.

## The Philosophy

We believe that **optimization is infrastructure**. It should be as reliable as a database and as fast as a cache lookup.

We reject the status quo of "pip install, run for 3 days, hope for the best."

## The Constitution

This project operates under a strict [Constitution](constitution.md) that mandates:

1.  **No Happy Path Testing**
2.  **No Silent Failures**
3.  **Zero Unbounded Growth**

Values are enforced by CI, not just written in docs.
